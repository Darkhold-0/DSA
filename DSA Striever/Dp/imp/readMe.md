The choice between using a map, unordered_map, or a 2D vector for dynamic programming (DP) largely depends on the specific use case, the problem constraints, and the efficiency requirements. Here's a comparison of the three approaches:

### 1. vector<vector<int>> (2D vector)
Usage: This is the most common approach for DP when the range of indices is known and not too large.
Pros:
Access Time: Constant time access, O(1), due to contiguous memory allocation.
Cache Friendly: Better cache performance because of contiguous memory.
Simplicity: Easy to implement and understand.
Cons:
Memory Usage: Fixed memory allocation, which might be inefficient if the DP table is sparsely populated.
Initialization: Requires predefined sizes for both dimensions, which might not always be feasible.
```
vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(k + 1, -1));
```
### 2. map<pair<int, int>, int> (std::map)
Usage: Suitable when the indices can be large or not contiguous, and we expect the DP table to be sparsely populated.
Pros:
Flexibility: Can handle arbitrary index ranges without predefining the size.
Sparse Table: Efficient memory usage when the DP table is sparsely populated.
Cons:
Access Time: Logarithmic time access, O(log N), due to the underlying balanced tree structure.
Complexity: Slightly more complex to implement compared to a 2D vector.
```
map<pair<int, int>, int> dp;
```
### 3. unordered_map<pair<int, int>, int> (std::unordered_map)
Usage: Similar to std::map, but with potentially better average access time due to hash table implementation.
Pros:
Access Time: Average constant time access, O(1), due to hash table structure.
Sparse Table: Efficient memory usage for sparse DP tables.
Cons:
Hashing Overhead: Requires a hash function for complex key types like pair<int, int>.
Collision Handling: Performance can degrade with high collision rates.
Non-Deterministic Order: Elements are not stored in a specific order, which can affect debugging.
```
unordered_map<pair<int, int>, int, hash_pair> dp;
```
```
struct hash_pair {
    template <class T1, class T2>
    size_t operator()(const pair<T1, T2>& p) const {
        auto hash1 = hash<T1>{}(p.first);
        auto hash2 = hash<T2>{}(p.second);
        return hash1 ^ hash2;
    }
};
```
## Summary
2D vector: Best for scenarios where the index range is known and the DP table is densely populated. Offers constant time access and better cache performance.
map<pair<int, int>, int>: Suitable for cases with large or unknown index ranges and sparse DP tables. Provides logarithmic time access.
unordered_map<pair<int, int>, int>: Ideal for large, sparse DP tables with average constant time access, but requires a custom hash function for complex keys.
Choosing the right data structure depends on the specific requirements of the problem you're solving, including constraints on index ranges, memory usage considerations, and access time efficiency.
